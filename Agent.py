.. py:class:: Agent

   .. automethod:: __init__

Class for generating and implementing Agents.

:param int numfacts: number of facts in the simulation 
 that are valuable

:param int numnoise: number of facts in the simulation 
 that are noise

:param float will: how frequently an agent will act
:param float comp: how frequently the agent will a fact 
 as valuable or not correctly (1: always, p: 
 p% of the time)

:param float spam:  how frequently the agent will send the 
 same fact to the same person (1 always, 0 never)

:param float selfish: how frequently the agent will drop 
 a fact and not send at all to a specific person 
 (0 never, 1 always)

:param int capacity: how many actions an agent can take 
 at each simulation step, 1 by default to implement 
 agents with limited cognitive resources.

:param Boolean trust_used: If True (default), keeps statistics 
 about Trust and sorts outbox by how much each neighbor is trusted 
 
:param Boolean inbox_trust_sorted: If True (default), periodically
 sorts the inbox by trust, processing facts from trusted neighbors
 first

:param Boolean trust_filter_on: If True (default), it only sends
 messages out to neighbors that are minimally trusted, the rest
 are filtered out.

:param Boolean uses_knowledge: True (default) if agent uses
 knowledge based processing and sends only facts it considers
 valuable. If False: it sends all facts regardless of value, used
 for hierarchical processing.
